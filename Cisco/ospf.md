### LSA (linked state advertisement)
### LSD (linked state Database)


There are three main steps in the process of sharing LSAs and determining the best route to each destination in the network
Become a neighbour
exchange lsa
calculate best route and insert them into routing table

## Ospf metrics

ospf metrics are called cost
it is automatically calculated based on the bandwidth of the internet
it is calculated by dividing a reference band/interface bandwidth

# Loopback interface

it is a virtual interface in the router
it is always ip
it is independent of physical interface
it can provide a consistent ip address that can be used to reach/identify the router

# network types

## ospf broadcast network type

it is enabled by default on ethernet and fddi
routers dynamically discover neighbours by sending/listening for ospf hello messages using multicast address
A designated router and backup designated router must be elected on each subnet 
routers which aren't DR or BDR become a DROther

## ospf neighbour requirements

they must be in same area
they must be in same network
ospf must not be shutdown
router ids must be unique
hello and dead timers must match
authenitication settings must match

## Lsa Types
ospf lsdb is made up of lsa

Type1:-
every router generates this types of lsa
it identifies the routers using router id
it also lists network attached to the router's ospf activated interfaces

Type 2:- (network lsa)
Generated by the DR of each multi-access network 
lists the routers which are attached to multi access network

Type 5: (AS external lsa)
generated by ASBRs to describe routes to destination ouutside of the AS
